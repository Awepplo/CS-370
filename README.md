# Project Summary
In this project, we were provided with necessary to run the specific tresure hunting games - such as the moves, point system, etc. We are required to create the Q-Algoritnm for storing and saving the different experiences the agent goes through in order to reach the finish with its goal of finding the treasure.

# Personal Perspective
This was a difficult, but rewarding project. Prior to taking this course, I believed machine learning was a topic that I would never fully understand, but after the reading and the articles used for the discussions in the course, I was able to grasp some of the important concepts about machine learning. It is important to approach this topic of machine learning with problem solving mindset. Although is not too difficult to start training a model, there are alot of specific variables that can alter the accuracy, time complexity, and effectiveness, and ethical concerns with machine learning. I plan to take this knowledge and incorporate it into my future projects. Once I was able to undestand that machine learning models are a tool to solve specific problems and can be a part of a larger solution.
